O2FEM++ requires 3 libraries to compile:

+ Cmake: tools for building the Makefile for the project
+ Boost: provide utilities for smart pointers, linear algebra and C++/python interface.
+ VTK: provide rendering components
+ Fox toolkit: provide utilities to create GUI

Users/developers are required to consult the installation instruction of those libraries for proper compilation/installation. It is recommended to compile those from source to use the latest functionality of the libraries. In my experience, compiling Cmake is straightforward with gcc compilers and Boost/VTK/Fox is straight forward with Cmake and gcc compilers.

The library path is required to compile the code. See configure.sh for the sample path setup.

To compile O2FEM++ under Linux, create the local build folder cmake_build
mkdir cmake_build

copy the configure script or sym-link it to cmake_build folder
ln -s ../configure.sh .

execute the configure script
sh configure.sh

From the next time, to compile the code, you only need to execute
make install -j4
